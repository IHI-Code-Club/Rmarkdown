# Introduction
We will examine gender differnces across UCL Departments[@UCL2017].

![UCL](img/ucl.jpg)

# Method
We will use a heiracical cluster analysis which si very __popular__, and is used by people like Zhou _et al._[-@Zhou2013].

# Results
we present data from `r nrow(data)` departments at UCL. 

```{r results, echo = F}
data$undergrad_ratio <- data$undergrad_male / data$undergrad_female
data$graduate_ratio <- data$graduate_male / data$graduate_female
data$total_ratio <- data$total_male / data$total_female
data <- data[order(data$total_ratio, decreasing = T),c(1, grep("ratio", names(data)))]
kable(head(data), row.names = F, caption = "Table1: Department with most men")
kable(tail(data), row.names = F, caption = "Table2: Department with most women")
```

## Clustering
For cluster analysis it is important to remember that 
* We should use continous variables 
* We should standardise data if types or ranges are different

```{r cluster, echo = F, fig.width=12, fig.height = 12}
m <- as.matrix(data[, 2:ncol(data)])
rownames(m) <- data$Department

mydist <- dist(m)
hc <- hclust(mydist)
plot(hc, cex = 0.8)
```

# Discussion
We did not really need any formulars in this document but, here is one just to demonstrate.
$$\sum_{n=1}^{10} n^2$$
